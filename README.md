The cyclic reduction (or odd-even reduction) is implemented in both CPU and GPU
for solving PDEs in 1D. 

* cyclic reduction (L) is the first implementation
* cyclic reduction (padding) (L) is above using padding as optimization to avoid divergence

Projects have compile.sh bash scripts for compilation.
